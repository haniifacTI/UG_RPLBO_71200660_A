# Welcome.... friends, lecturer, co-lecturer, and strangers!!!
This Repository is used for assigning my unguided task in Rekayasa Perangkat Lunak Berorientasi Objek (RPLBO in short).
This repo will consist of java program (mostly) and software development stuff(s).
You can clone this repo AFTER the class ends, for educational purpose ofc.

## Closing Word
I Hope that this repo will be a silent witness for my hardwork, because there is an old saying that says "Hard work pays off".
One day in the near future, i will look once more to this repo and be grateful of all the efforts i put to do these assignment.
Thank you, have a good day, and god bless.
